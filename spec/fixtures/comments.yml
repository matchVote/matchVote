    The Big Tent had become big enough to enclose an idealogical war zone.
    Now the fighting is spilling outside and everyone nearby is getting sucked
    into the fight and hurt in the process. All that seems to matter to many is
    that their side is the eventual winner. I don't know which option is worse.
    The government grinding to a halt as this fight plays out, or one side
    'winning' and railroading their fever dreams through Congress and the
    White House unopposed.

    It's like the end of "Jurassic Park," when the tyrannosaurus rescues the
    heroes from the velociraptors.

    If the President and Mr. Ryan are serious about taking on the factions,
    they will have to confront gerrymandering as that is how the group exercises
    a disproportionate influence in the House. Good luck with that!

    I honestly don't understand why Trump is alienating Democrats AND the
    Freedom Caucus. He literally doesn't have enough votes to pass anything
    without reaching out to either group. What is his endgame here? To just
    fight a lot and get nothing done? Seriously, I find this baffling.
