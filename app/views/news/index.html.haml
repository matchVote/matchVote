                %li One day later, the polls will close in Montana’s special election for the state’s sole House seat, which pits Democratic musician Rob Quist against Republican businessman Greg Gianforte.
                %li Quist, a populist who is campaigning with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) this weekend, has aggressively run against the AHCA, dubbing it a “tax cut for millionaires.”

                %li President Trump took to Twitter to say that the Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative Republicans in the House, is hurting the party’s agenda.
                %li “We must fight them” in 2018, he said, days after the faction helped kill his health care overhaul, imperiling Mr. Trump’s other priorities.
                %li Over the past few days, Mr. Trump has lurched between battering and buttering up conservatives who killed his health care overhaul in an agenda-scuttling insurrection that imperils his plans for tax reform and a trillion-dollar infrastructure package.
